Keep Azure PowerShell updated
=============================

            

The Azure PowerShell cmdlets are updated frequently to keep up with the frequent changes in Microsoft Azure. If you don't install updates, you won't be able to use the newest functionality. This script will create a scheduled task that checks daily
 for a new release of Azure PowerShell on GitHub. When it finds a new release, it will then use WebPI to download and install the new release.

 

        
    
TechNet gallery is retiring! This script was migrated from TechNet script center to GitHub by Microsoft Azure Automation product group. All the Script Center fields like Rating, RatingCount and DownloadCount have been carried over to Github as-is for the migrated scripts only. Note : The Script Center fields will not be applicable for the new repositories created in Github & hence those fields will not show up for new Github repositories.
